Method references can be seen as shorthand for lambdas calling only a specific method.

When you need a method reference, the target reference is
placed before the delimiter :: and the name of the method is provided after it. For example,
Apple::getWeight is a method reference to the method getWeight defined in the Apple class.

Lambda 										Method reference equivalent
(Apple a) -> a.getWeight() 					Apple::getWeight
() -> Thread.currentThread().dumpStack() 	Thread.currentThread()::dumpStack
(str, i) -> str.substring(i) 				String::substring
(String s) -> System.out.println(s) 		System.out::println

You can think of method references as syntactic sugar for lambdas that refer only to a single
method because you write less to express the same thing.
